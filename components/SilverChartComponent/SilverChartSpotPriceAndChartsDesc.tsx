          The spot price of silver refers to the present market value at which
          one can purchase an ounce of unrefined silver and resell it for
          immediate delivery. Because the spot price of silver constantly
          changes, investors should stay updated on current affairs, market
          conditions, and other performance indicators as they impact buying and
